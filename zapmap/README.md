# Old New York

Compare old New York with with new New York by browsing an interactive map!

Inspired by and data from: https://github.com/danvk/oldnyc

## 5k Challenge

This 5k app is a map with markers on intersections that have old photos associated with.
Tapping a marker will open up the street views and the historic photos side by side so that
you can compare old New York with new New York.

There is limited effort that tries to compensate for different screen sizes and densities,
but all of the code was kept in mostly non-obfuscated shape, and dartfmt was used.
